This coding challenge was built using React.

To access the are-you-still-there app, follow [this link.](https://are-you-still-there-jtg3yo9tm.now.sh/)

View 1 shows a homepage where after 10 seconds, a modal appears asking the user, "Are you still there?" If the user clicks "I'm still here", the 10 second timer begins again. If the user clicks nothing, after 5 seconds, View 2 appears with a modal informing the user they have been logged out and have the option to go "Back to home." If the user clicks "Back to home", they are brought back to View 1 where the 10 seconds start all over again.
